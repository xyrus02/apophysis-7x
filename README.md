# Apophysis 7X
Apophysis was written with Delphi 5.0 and is now developed using Delphi XE2

The rendering engine (with some modifications) comes from a screensaver by Ronald Hordijk: http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~rhordijk/progs.html#flame
The original flame code was written by Scott Draves: http://flam3.com/index.cgi?&menu=code
